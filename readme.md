## image delta

A field formatter for image fields, that allows you to display just a single image.

This is usefull when you allow multiple images to be uploaded but only want to show the first image on a teaser.

This module will become obsolete once [d.o#1234624](https://www.drupal.org/node/1234624) lands (probably 8.2)

Alternative modules:
* (field_multiple_limit)[https://www.drupal.org/project/field_multiple_limit] but it uses an alternative approach.

### How to install

Using composer:

```
composer require harings/image_delta
```
